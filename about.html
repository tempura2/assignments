                    <h1>People</h1>
                    <p>Finns view themselves as egalitarian people whose culture is based on democratic principles of respect and interdependence. They like people for who they are and not for what they do for a living, their professional accomplishments, or how much money they earn.</p>

                    <h1>Personality</h1> 
                    <p>Although the Finns often seem silent, it does not mean that they are not warm-hearted. Finns believe that they should break the silence only when they have something valuable to say. Finns are often very punctual in their work. Work is done quietly, quickly, and conscientiously.</p>

                    <h1>Music</h1>
                    <p>Finland is a country where people love tango. However, Finnish tango is not as energetic as the Argentinean tango but rather emotionally charged. Each year in Seinäjoki, the “Tango Capital,” the Finnish king and queen of tango are chosen. They have to not only dance but also sing. In Finland, jazz music is highly popular, with the most famous Finnish jazz festival held annually in Pori.</p>

                    <h1>Literature</h1>
                    <p>Any discussion of Finnish literature must start with the “Kalevala,” the national epic of Finland. Elias Lönnrot, in the mid-19th century, compiled folk songs and wove them together into the epic “Kalevala.” He claimed he merely laid the pieces together, but in reality, he created a completely new work.</p>
